  confirmation dialog
9-08-08 - fixed a few bugs, fixed where replace was smaller than find it wasn't truncating the file
  when the file was getting re-written causing leftover bits at the end of the file. Also fixed cancel
  not actually cancelling anything, and put the filepath in the confirm dialog now
